Things and Stuff


My name is Lauren Amick, and I am learning this highly renowned tool called GitHub. I have been actively working in application development for about a year and a half as of this day, the 23rd of August, 2016. I enjoy bowling, ping pong, slacklining, disc golf, and music. Everything else is terrible! 

I enjoy most everything except for heights and spiders.
